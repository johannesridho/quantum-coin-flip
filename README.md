## How to Run
1. To run it in a real quantum computer: 
  - Create an account in [IBM Quantum Experience](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com)
  - Import the code from quantum-coin-flip.ipynb
2. You can also run it locally after installing jupyter notebook and [qiskit](https://qiskit.org) in your local machine
